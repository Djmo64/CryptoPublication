  <h1><i>8 Reasons why Cryptocurrency Should be Taxed.</i></h1>
  <div style="color: white">hey</div>
<p style="text-indent: 60px">Why it should be taxed: first and foremost, all crypto currency is classified as property in the united states,
   it is compared to stuff like having gold or stocks, anything of value to trade for goods and services. 
   If it generates a capital gain your bound to be taxed for it. The 16th amendment states “The Congress shall 
   ave power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the 
   several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.” this applies to crypto as well this is 
   intangible property that fits under the parameters of U.S. law. However, cryptocurrency is only taxed when a 
   transaction is made with it, in other words a ‘taxable event’ so just having it in your possession does not make
    mean you have to pay a tax for it every year despite it being classified as property in that sense its similar to
     stocks. 45% of government tax revenue comes from individual income tax, this is money that provides things such
      as public schooling, police forces, museums/public parks, and national defense. As well as paying government
       officials in order to make and pass laws across the country. Cryptocurrency is reaching the point where digital
        currency that is not under the jurisdiction of a government is being used by more and more people and the 
        collections of government revenue will begin to decrease. Not only will unregulated use of crypto rapidly
         affect our economy domestically it will affect our global economic standings as well. The US dollar acts
          as a reserve currency for the global economy. And many financial transactions happen around the world on
           the basis of the dollar. And these global transactions that happen is a primary source of the United 
           states global power, allowing them to put economic sanctions on some countries. Since crypto does not 
           have any government affiliation those domestic and international powers weaken by unreported use of crypto 
           currencies. a perfect example of this is the events surrounding a web site on the dark web known as the silk
            road. Crypto currency singlehandedly facilitated the growth of this website due to the currency's anonymity 
            and regulated transactions. In conclusion I believe crypto currency should be taxed.
             It helps regulate its growing use, decrease the affects it would have in the economy domestically and
              globally, it is with the parameters of the united states constitution to do so, and  
              it helps keep people aware of digital currency, a currency where the majority of its transactions
               in the past were used to buy illegal products. </p>
